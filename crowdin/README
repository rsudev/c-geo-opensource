INSTALLATION

- create a NEW local repo from the github repo
  -> the scripts automatically run git pull, git push, git commit
  -> DON'T DO ANY WORK ON THIS REPO!! It will be pushed automatically!
  -> this repo can be a copy (cp -a) from an existing one
- copy crowdin/credentials.template to crowdin/credentials
- edit crowdin/credentials
  -> find the API-KEY here http://crowdin.net/project/cgeo/settings#project-settings-api
- prepare crowdin:
  - run update manually

if we want to automate this:
- create a cronjob to run crowdin/download every 60 mins or trigger it somehow
- create a cronjob to run crowdin/update every 60 mins or trigger it somehow

THE SCRIPTS

Run all scripts from within a repo.

- update: no arguments
  -> this will upload the base language file values/strings.xml to crowdin, depending on the current branch.
    from master, it will upload to master and globals, from release to release. other branches are not allowed.

- download: optional argument: pr
  -> this will download the language files from crowdin. if the parameter 'pr' is present, it will create/update a 
     pull request against master or release, depending on the current branch, if necessary
